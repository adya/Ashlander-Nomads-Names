**Ashlander Nomads Names** is a [NND](https://github.com/adya/NPCs-Names-Distributor)-based mod that provides names for some Dunmers that inhabit Solstheim. It is some sort of an expansion to [Tamrielic Names](https://github.com/adya/Tamrielic-Names) and adds an additional layer of lore details.

See [Ashlander Nomads Names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73315) on Nexus for detailed description.
